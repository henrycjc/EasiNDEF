# NDEF Library for Arduino

Original README.md here: https://github.com/don/NDEF

This is a minor rewrite because the original repo looks pretty abandoned (with a stack of unanswered PRs all years old). 

This fork hopes to address: style & compiler warnings, (the lack of) error checking and (the lack of) optimisation.
